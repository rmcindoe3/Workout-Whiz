Workout Whiz
================

A streamlined application for keeping track of exercise sets over time.  The core concept was to create an application that can be used to dynamically create and manage workouts.  The UI was designed to have as few button presses as possible so that the application will be usable while in the middle of working out.

How to set up Android project:
1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Using your IDE of choice, import the DASHStreamer folder as an existing Android project.
3. Clean/Build the project.

I did not make use of the appcompat libraries for this project and because of this I actually ended up remaking a lot of UI elements on my own.  If I have time in the future I would like to remake the project while taking advanatage of some of the newer libraries available.
